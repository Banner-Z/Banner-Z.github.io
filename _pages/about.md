<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a NLP researcher at [Zhipu AI](https://www.zhipuai.cn), working with [Dr. Cunxiang Wang](https://wangcunxiang.github.io). Before that, I received M.S from the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Soochow University, advised by [Assoc. Prof. Juntao Li](https://lijuntaopku.github.io/) and [Prof. Min Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=CncXH-YAAAAJ).

🤔 My major research interests are about **evaluation**, **agent** and **post training**.
