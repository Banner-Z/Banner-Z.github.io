<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year master’s student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Soochow University, advised by [Assoc. Prof. Juntao Li(李俊涛)](https://lijuntaopku.github.io/) and [Prof. Min Zhang(张民)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=CncXH-YAAAAJ).

I am currently an algorithm intern at [miHoYo(米哈游)](https://www.mihoyo.com/) as a part of **INVERSE ENTROPY(逆熵) AI Group**, focusing on AI-driven UGC games under the mentorship of [Ryuichi Takanobu(高信龙一)](https://truthless11.github.io/).

Before this, I worked as an algorithm intern at [Baidu(百度) Ernie Bot(文心一言)](https://yiyan.baidu.com/), focusing primarily on language model alignment and role-playing dialogues under the mentorship of [Jun Xu(徐俊)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=uGy95bgAAAAJ).

🤔 My major research interests are about **dialog systems**, **LLM-as-a-judge** and **superalignment**, and I am actively exploring practical implementations and academic research in these areas ...
