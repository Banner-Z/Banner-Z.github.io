<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a last-year master’s student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Soochow University, advised by [Assoc. Prof. Juntao Li](https://lijuntaopku.github.io/) and [Prof. Min Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=CncXH-YAAAAJ).

At present, I am working as a research intern at [Zhipu AI](https://www.zhipuai.cn) under the mentorship of [Cunxiang Wang](https://wangcunxiang.github.io).

I was a research intern at [miHoYo](https://www.mihoyo.com/) as a part of INVERSE ENTROPY AI Group, focusing on AI-driven UGC games under the mentorship of [Ryuichi Takanobu](https://truthless11.github.io/).
Before this, I worked as an intern at [Baidu Ernie Bot](https://yiyan.baidu.com/), focusing primarily on dialog evaluation and correction under the mentorship of [Jun Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=uGy95bgAAAAJ).

🤔 My major research interests are about **evaluation**, **agent** and **post training**.
